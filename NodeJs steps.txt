1. Initialize a new npm project:
   
   npm init
   

2. Install Express.js and save it as a dependency:
   
   npm install express --save
   

3. Create an `index.js` file with the following content:
 
   const express = require('express');
   const app = express();

   // Serve static files from the 'public' directory
   app.use(express.static('public'));

   // Start the server on port 4000
   app.listen(4000, () => {
   	console.log("Server Has Started on PORT: 4000");
   });
   

4. Run the server by executing:
   
   node index.js
   

5. Open a browser and navigate to `localhost:4000` to see your HTML content served by Express.
